i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	
ANS: Yes, In the first group business opens for less hour but in 2nd group it open for longer hours.


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

ANS: Not strongly as per the data. In 1st group some business has high rating even it has less reviews.
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

--ANS: As in the 1st group data is not available about neighborhood, so I can't comment on this.

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
		Let GROUP-1: Closed (is_open=0)
			GROUP-2: Open 	(is_open=1)
i. Difference 1:
		Overall percentage stars ratig of group-1 is 3.66 whereas GROUP-2 has higher 3.89
         
        CODE:
		--GROUP-1
			SELECT sum(stars)/count(id)
			FROM business
			WHERE is_open=0
			ORDER BY sum(stars)/count(id) DESC
			
		--GROUP-2
			SELECT sum(stars)/count(id)
			FROM business
			WHERE is_open=1 
			ORDER BY sum(stars)/count(id) DESC
		
ii. Difference 2:
		
		GROUP-1 has average cool review 7 and GROUP-2 has 11.
			So, customers more attracted towards the higher cool rating bussiness.

		CODE:
		SELECT(
			SELECT sum(R.cool)/count(B.id)
			FROM business B INNER JOIN review R ON B.id=R.business_id
			WHERE is_open=0
			GROUP BY cool
			ORDER BY sum(R.cool)/count(B.id) DESC) AS closed,
			(
			SELECT sum(R.cool)/count(B.id)
			FROM business B INNER JOIN review R ON B.id=R.business_id
			WHERE is_open=1
			GROUP BY cool
			ORDER BY sum(R.cool)/count(B.id) DESC) AS opened
		
		OUTPUT:
			+--------+--------+
			| closed | opened |
			+--------+--------+
			|      7 |     11 |
			+--------+--------+

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

        clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

        The tables needed for the analysis are business,category and attribute. 
		Why?
		The business can be easly analysed and clustered based on the attribute like ambience they are offering, price range, age limit soon.
		This analysis will be helpful for the types of business exist in a city and which type of new business can be install in future.
		comparing different business cluster with each other and get to know the future growth.
		
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

	Analysis:1. Comparison of most review_count to least review_count.
		The business having most review_count are neighborhood of The Strip.
	
	Code: 	SELECT id,review_count,stars,neighborhood
			from business
			order by review_count DESC
